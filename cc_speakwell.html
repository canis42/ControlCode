<h1>Sinsations CC Speakwell</h1>
<p>SpeakWell checks what a subbie speaks. You can forbid words or limit the
length of a sentence. If the subbie fails, then a punishment is played
consisting of sounds, animations and RLV-restrictions. The punishment may end
after a given time or if the subbie speaks a penance sentence.
(see the <a href="http://mm.ymir.de/manuals/cc_punish.html">Punish Module</a></p>
<p>The three items Banneds, Partials and Exacts allow to give lists of words
to forbid to speak. They are given as words delimited by commatas.</p>
